        <p>Recipe for an egg, cheese, and bacon Breakfast Burrito.</p>

        <h1>Breakfast Buritto</h1>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs.</li>
            <li>1 soft flour tortilla.</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of mexian blend cheese.</li>
            <li>1 strip of bacon.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay down the tortilla then put the cheese in a line down the center.</li>
            <li>Put a frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, melt a small amount of butter in the pan. Lay the bacon in the pan and cook until crispy. Set it aside on a paper towl.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into the pan then scramble them.</li>
            <li>Turn off the stove. Put the eggs over the cheese on the tortilla. Then, crush up the bacon strip. I like to put it in a resealable bag then mash it up. Sprinkle the bacon over the eggs.</li>
            <li>Wrap up the tortilla by folding a small section on either end of the section of eggs and cheese, then fold another side over the entire contents, finally roll it over the last section of the tortilla.</li>
            <li>Clean out the pan and put it back over medium heat. Once hot, melt a small amount of butter in the pan then gently lay the buritto in the pan. make sure the side with the overlap is facing down. Leave the burrito in the pan for about 5-7 minutes or until golden brown. Then, flip to the other side and leave it for another 5-7 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your breakfast burrito :]</li>
